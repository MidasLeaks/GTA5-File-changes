## BEFORE UPDATE
Casino Randomiser = (0.005 > 0.015) // This means that for a player to get jackpot theres this amount of RNG (randomness)

## AFTER UPDATE
Caino Randomiser = (10.00 <0.005 = 0.015> 20.00)
//This means if a player wins jackpot more than 5 times in a 7 day time frame it will be flagged for rockstar as the rng should not go above 0.015 which is only one jackbot doing 4 would be over which means the player is modding
